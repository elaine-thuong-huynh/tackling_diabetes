# tackling_diabetes
The project involves using three ML techniques: Neural Network, CART and Random Forest to determine the best techniques to improve the accuracy of Health Promotion Board's diabetes risk assessment. After comparing the overall accuracy as well as sensitivity and specificity, Neural Network is chosen as the optimal model.
The project also uses Association Rules to identify demographics that are highly vulnerable to diabetes to run outreach programs targeting at them.
